# My First Rails Blog! 

Hey there! This is my practice blog app where I'm learning Ruby on Rails. I built it by following along with [GoRails' Build a Blog with Rails 7 series](https://gorails.com/series/build-a-blog-with-rails-7).

## What I Learned to Build 🛠

### Core Features
- Blog posts with rich text editing (thanks ActionText!)
- User authentication (Devise is pretty cool)
- Scheduled posts (can set publish dates)
- File uploads with ActiveStorage + Amazon S3
- Pagination (using the Pagy gem)
- Cover images for posts

### Tech Stuff I Used
- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- PostgreSQL in production
- SQLite in development
- Hotwire/Turbo for some fancy dynamic updates

### Testing
- Built some model tests
- System tests for features
- Learned about fixtures (especially with Devise)

## Deployment 🚀
This app is living on Render! Check it out here: [https://ruby-on-rails-blog-tutorial.onrender.com]

## Local Setup
If you want to run this locally (though it's just a practice app):
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rails db:create`
4. Run `rails db:migrate`
5. Run `rails server`


## Credit Where Credit's Due 🙏
Huge thanks to [GoRails](https://gorails.com/) for the awesome tutorials that helped me learn Rails!

*Note: This is a learning project, so it might have rough edges - and that's okay! I'm using it to understand Rails better.* 😊
