# 1. Set Ruby 3.1.4 as the local version for your project directory
# This creates a .ruby-version file in your project
rbenv local 3.1.4

# 2. Verify that the correct Ruby version is active
# Should output: ruby 3.1.4pXXX (where XXX is the patch level)
ruby -v

# 3. Install the specific Rails version you need
# This makes Rails 7.0.4.3 available to your Ruby environment
gem install rails -v 7.0.4.3

# 4. Install all project dependencies from your Gemfile
# This ensures all gems are installed with versions compatible with Ruby 3.1.4
bundle install

# Optional but recommended - use bundle exec to run Rails commands
# This ensures you're using your project's specific gem versions
bundle exec rails s  # starts the server
bundle exec rails c  # starts the console
bundle exec rails g  # for generators
