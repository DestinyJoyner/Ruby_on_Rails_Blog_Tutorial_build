- define root route on config/route.rb
    -  # Defines the root path route ("/")
            root "blog_posts#index"
- need to create controller and define index action in that folder
    - controllers/blog_posts_controller.rb

- Flow from config/route.rb
    # Defines the root path route ("/")
    # blog_posts tells Rails to look for BlogPostsController due to syntax formatting of BlogPosts -> blog_posts
    # blog_posts â†’ looks for app/controllers/blog_posts_controller.rb
    # #index tells Rails to call the index method in that controller -> hence creation of class and creation of index method (action)
    # controller class must be BlogPostsController (Rails automatically converts snake_case to CamelCase)
    # The index method in the controller automatically looks for a view in app/views/blog_posts/index.html.erb
    # The index.html.erb file is automatically rendered when the index action is called

    - This is:  Rails' "Convention over Configuration" principle in action - by following these naming conventions, Rails automatically knows how to connect all these components without requiring explicit configuration.
