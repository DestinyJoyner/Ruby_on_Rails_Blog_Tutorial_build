MVC PATTERN - Model View Controller -> organization pattern for code in web applications
Model:
- database layer -> how query, validate, process and add info into database 
- Represents the data and business logic of the application
View:
- Represents the UI of the application (html, json, xml)
- Displays data to the user 
Controller:
- Manages the interaction between the model and the view
- Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly
- handles request and how things are processed
- ex: make a portion of app admin only -> test auth and redirect accordingly

Ex.: /sign-up route (path) -> which controller to send request to -> can make request to user model -> to render form for user -> user submits and data is processed
    - get, post, request etc...
