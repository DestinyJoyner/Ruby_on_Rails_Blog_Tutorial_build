     - gem called 'pagy' : bundle add pagy
     - application_controller.rb -> include Pagy::Backend
     - application_helper.rb ->  include Pagy::Frontend

Debugging Pagy Tailwind Styling:

Pagy navigation wasn't showing any styling
Started with Pagy's documentation example using @apply directives
Testing File Loading
Added a test style (background-color: red !important)
Confirmed CSS file was being read when red background appeared

Found that @apply directive was showing as "unknown rule"
This indicated a Tailwind processing issue
Understanding the Setup
Realized we were using tailwindcss-rails gem
This gem has a different setup than standalone Tailwind

Switched from Tailwind's @apply syntax to regular CSS
Kept the same visual styling but used standard CSS properties
Used direct CSS values that match Tailwind's design system
Verification
Ran rails tailwindcss:build
Confirmed styles were now applying correctly
Navigation showed proper styling
